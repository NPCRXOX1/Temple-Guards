            <h2>Formations</h2>
            <p><strong>What is a Formation?</strong></p>
            <p>A formation refers to the arrangement of Temple Guards during a fight, patrol, or event. It is a structured layout designed to enhance the effectiveness, efficiency, and coordination of Temple Guards during their operations. Temple Guards are expected to fall into formation when a Warden(+) orders. Formations must start with an uppercase letter and end with punctuation either in the form of a '.' or '!' to be valid. The following are all official formations within the Temple Guard division:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Shoulder-to-shoulder with other Temple Guards while facing the commander.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Specific Rules</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>If there is a 'Prepare, Kick, March!' sequence, if 'March,' 'prepare,' or 'kick!' are improper, the sequence is invalid.</li>
                <li>'March!' is only broken by 'Halt!'</li>
                <li>'Inverse' is a tag that is applicable to the wing and wedge commands. It cannot be applied to walls, shoulder to shoulder, single file line, double column, box, or orbis commands.</li>
                <li>If a command is followed by an individual's name or rank, e.g., 'Box, KillerAureus.' Temple Guards will box around that individual rather than the host.</li>
                <li>If the host moves after calling a formation, Temple Guards will be expected to follow the host and re-enter formation in alignment with the host.</li>
            </ul>
