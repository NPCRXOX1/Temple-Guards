            <h2>Recommendations</h2>
            <p>Recommendations are earned by Temple Guards who perform well at events, complete special tasks, or otherwise catch the attention of a Warden(+). Recommendations will not carry over upon ranking up.</p>
            <p>Wardens Here are some examples of how to obtain a recommendation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Passing a faces and formations training without making a single error.</li>
                <li>Winning against the host in a Combat Training.</li>
                <li>Guarding the temple with a Warden(+) and exhibiting combat skills.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Special Tasks</h2>
            <p>Special Tasks are designed to help Temple Guards earn recommendations by receiving a task from a Captain(+). A Temple Guard may request one Special Task per rank. The Captain(+) will determine what the task will be, and the difficulty of the task will increase based on the rank of the individual requesting it.</p>
            <p>An example of a special task would be obtaining 20 kills during a Temple Guard patrol.</p>
