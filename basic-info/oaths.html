            <h2>Oath of Genesis</h2>
            <p>I have taken the trials, I have given my best. Now I wear the helmet of light, and bear the robes of wisdom. Though I have completed my trial, my work has just begun. I am a new beginning of an end. I am a prodigy. I am a Temple Guard.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Oath of Loyalty</h2>
            <p>I will be loyal to the Temple Guard. I will never dispute an order, unless it contradicts our beliefs. I pledge my service, and life, to the Temple Guard when necessary. I will never betray, or sell out my brothers and sisters. My loyalty unbroken is priceless.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Oath of Silence</h2>
            <p>I will speak only when necessary, I will never complain. I will only speak freely when off-duty, though still little will I speak. For a moment of silence, is for eternity. I will never speak out of terms, from this day forth. I conceal my identity and remain silent, for all I must do is defend and serve others. Silently.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Induction Ceremony Oath</h2>
            <p>I am the Temple's protector, as it has protected me. It houses our knowledge, our history, our legacy. I will give my life, and take anotherâ€™s, to protect it. One with the Temple, one with the Force. I rise.</p>
